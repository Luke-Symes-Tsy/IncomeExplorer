# Income Explorer
This package contains the software for running the Income Explorer Application,
which enables the graphically interactive calculation and display of income components and 
effective marginal tax rate for user specified household parameters, with fixed
tax/welfare settings.

The underlying calculation is done by the function `emtr` in the file emtr.R,
which may be useful outside of the GUI.
